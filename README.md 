## What is Hangman?

**Hangman** is a traditional game where a player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time.
For every incorrect guess, a part of a stick-figure "hangman" is drawn.
The player wins by guessing the full word before the drawing is completed â€” or loses when all parts are drawn.
